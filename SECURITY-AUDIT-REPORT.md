**Total Vulnerabilities Fixed: 12**  
**npm audit result: 0 vulnerabilities**

## Content Security Policy (CSP) Improvements

### Before (Insecure)

```
img-src *                    ← Allows ANY domain
connect-src *                ← Allows ANY domain
Missing: object-src          ← Plugin execution not blocked
Missing: base-uri            ← Base tag injection possible
Missing: form-action         ← Forms can submit anywhere
Missing: frame-ancestors     ← Clickjacking possible
```

### After (Secure)

```
img-src 'self' data: blob: https://picsum.photos https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com https://www.timmons.com https://covers.openlibrary.org https://avatars.githubusercontent.com
connect-src 'self' https://analytics.umami.is https://giscus.app https://vitals.vercel-insights.com
object-src 'none'            ← NEW: Blocks plugin execution
base-uri 'self'              ← NEW: Prevents base tag injection
form-action 'self'           ← NEW: Restricts form submissions
frame-ancestors 'none'       ← NEW: Prevents clickjacking
```

**Impact**: Significantly reduces attack surface by allowing only explicitly trusted domains.

## HTTP Security Headers Improvements

### Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

- **Before**: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- **After**: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- **Benefit**: Eligible for HSTS preload list, protecting users even on first visit

### Existing Strong Headers (Maintained)

- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- ✅ Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()

## Environment Variable Protection

### Changes

- Added `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Verified no secrets in repository history
- Documentation added for proper secret management

## Documentation Improvements

### New Files Created

1. **SECURITY.md** - Comprehensive security documentation including:
   - All implemented security measures
   - Security best practices for contributors
   - Vulnerability reporting process
   - Regular maintenance procedures
   - Links to security resources (OWASP, MDN, etc.)

## Risk Assessment

### Before Remediation

- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Critical Issues**: 1 (Next.js vulnerabilities)
- **Moderate Issues**: 11 (dependency vulnerabilities)
- **CSP Weakness**: Wildcard domains allow broad access
- **Attack Vectors**: XSS, cache poisoning, DoS, authorization bypass

### After Remediation

- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Critical Issues**: 0
- **Moderate Issues**: 0
- **CSP Strength**: Strict allowlist of trusted domains only
- **Attack Vectors**: Significantly reduced with defense in depth

## Compliance

This remediation brings the website in line with:

- ✅ OWASP Top 10 security practices
- ✅ Next.js security best practices
- ✅ Modern web security standards
- ✅ CSP Level 3 recommendations

## Maintenance Recommendations

To maintain security posture:

1. **Weekly**: Monitor for new security advisories
2. **Monthly**: Run `npm audit` and update dependencies
3. **Quarterly**: Review and update CSP rules
4. **Annually**: Conduct full security audit

## Conclusion

All identified security vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated. The website now has:

- Zero npm package vulnerabilities
- Strong Content Security Policy with explicit domain allowlists
- Enhanced HSTS with preload support
- Comprehensive security documentation
- Proper secret management practices

The security posture has been significantly improved from HIGH risk to LOW risk.
