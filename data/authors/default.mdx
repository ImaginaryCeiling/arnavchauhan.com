Welcome! I'm Arnav Chauhan, a sophomore at Panther Creek High School. I'm interested in all sorts of things, but some things I am most passionate about include learning about new technologies and having a positive impact in the STEM community around me. 

I love spending time playing sports (running, swimming, pickleball - you name it). I'm connecting new technologies and skills I have with those same sports as a way to find the optimal way to extract performance and improve. This is a sneak peek into a project I hope to post soon so stay tuned ðŸ˜‰

This website is going to contain posts and projects about things I would like to share and stuff I am working on. I've had the idea for arnavchauhan.com for a while now, and I'm glad it's finally time for everyone to see. If you enjoy what you see here, please feel free to reach out and continue the discussion.]
