Welcome! I'm Arnav Chauhan, a Founder at OneFootGo and a junior at Panther Creek High School in Cary, NC. I'm interested in all sorts of things, but I am most passionate about learning new technologies and having a positive impact in the STEM community around me. 

I love spending time playing sports (running, swimming, tennis, pickleball - you name it). I'm connecting new technologies and skills I have with those same sports as a way to find the optimal way to extract performance and improve. Most of my work has been done with [OneFootGo](https://onefootgo.com), a SportsTech company I started to provide access to provide every single athlete with the same tools that the professionals have.

I'm currently also working on making [BuildRTP](https://buildrtp.org) a reality, which is meant to provide all students in the Research Triangle Park area with a space to build their passions. It is inspired from my experience with Buildspace in San Francisco, where I saw firsthand the effects of having a supportive community rallying behind you. If you want to learn more or can support our mission in any way, please reach out!
