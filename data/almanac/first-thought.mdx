summary: 'Why I decided to start sharing my thoughts more openly'

I've been thinking a lot about building in public lately. There's something powerful about sharing your work, your struggles, and your wins with the world.

Most of my best opportunities have come from people who discovered my work online. A random tweet, a GitHub project, a blog post - these small digital breadcrumbs have led to conversations, collaborations, and connections I never would have made otherwise.

The Almanac is my experiment in sharing smaller thoughts that don't need full blog posts. Sometimes a complete thought is just a paragraph or two.
