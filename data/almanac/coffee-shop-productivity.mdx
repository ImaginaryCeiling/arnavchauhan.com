summary: 'Why I get more done in coffee shops'
---

Coffee shops are productivity goldmines for me. Not because of the caffeine (though that helps), but because of the ambient noise and the subtle social pressure.

When I'm at home, I have infinite distractions. Every unfinished project calls to me. The kitchen is right there. Netflix is one click away.

But in a coffee shop, I'm surrounded by other people who are also trying to get things done. There's an unspoken accountability. Plus, I paid $5 for this latte, so I better make it count.

The best coffee shops have just the right amount of noise - enough to create a bubble of focus, not so much that it's distracting.
