summary: 'There is no ceiling on effort'

I believe that ceilings are self imposed (in terms of what we think we can achieve).

Although there are many factors out of our control, there is no ceiling on effort.

Therefore, to maximize your chances of succeeding, make sure that you are not being blocked by your own efforts. In the words of Flo Rida, "raise the roof".
