summary: 'We are losing patience.'

As I write this, I am waiting for Claude Code to finish ticking off some of the tasks I assigned it. I was in a hurry to do something so I wrote a pretty long and detailed prompt with many tasks to do so that it would "stay busy". 

It felt annoying to actually write a long and detailed prompt. Following some introspection, I came to a pretty damning conclusion about society: we are losing patience. 

It shows in not just the way we write prompts for AI, but also in the way we interact with each other and complete tasks. In a world where it's so easy to have content made, we fail to put effort into creation. It begins with "Have *(AI tool of choice)* make it", then becomes an automated email answerer, and will eventually start becoming the only medium for us to communicate in.

Our single advantage as a collective humanity is that we can add flavor and character (read: individuality) in each thing we do. By giving up control over our personality to the next big AI tool that takes the market, we lose the one factor that sets us apart from every other thing on this planet.

There a sense of foreboding that comes from all of this. Human nature will never turn down a shortcut. That's just the way we have evolved to optimize for survival. Unfortunately, by continuously taking shortcuts, we lose our sense of detail, effort, and even self because each instance of higher-level thinking is now outsourced. 

Regardless, we must continue to forge along. As the barriers to getting something done get lower and lower, our identities will go away faster and faster. It's only going to get harder to resist the easy way out, but to preserve ourselves as a collective humanity, we need to put the time and effort to make it happen.
