summary: 'There is no ceiling on effort.'

I believe that ceilings are self imposed (in terms of what we think we can achieve).

Although there are many factors out of our control, there is no ceiling on effort.

Therefore, to maximize your chances of succeeding, make sure that you are not being blocked by your own efforts.

This comes with a caveat. Just because you are putting in effort, doesn't mean that you are doing the right things. If you're doing performative busywork, you're better off not doing it at all. Be purposeful with your time.

Use motion as a litmus test: Am I moving towards my goals?
